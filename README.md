**User Management**: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
**Property Management**: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
**Booking System**: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
**Payment Processing**: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
**Data Optimization**: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## Tech Stack

**Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
**Django REST Framework**: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
**PostgreSQL**: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
**GraphQL**: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
**Celery**: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
**Redis**: Used for caching and session management.
**Docker**: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
**CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.
